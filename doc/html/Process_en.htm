<h2>Processes</h2>

 Processes are used for NumericControl, simulation, kinematic.
 A model can have many processes.
 A process can be created with "Process/Create";
  here the name of the process must be entered und a processor must
  be selected. An (empty) process will be created.
 Next activate the process with "Process/Select-Start" (or Ctrl-P).
 Now create the process code; see documentation for the selected processor.

 Processes can use all internal functions.
 System-neutral user interfaces can be created with the GUI-Tool "C-Kit-GUI".
 Prozessors are load modules, compiled (Language C or other).
 Each prozessor can have its specific set of commands.
 The process (the codes) are stored in the model
   in "SECTION PROCESS {processname}"
